# ToDo-App
A Django-React to-do app is a web application that combines the backend capabilities of Django, a Python-based web framework, with the frontend interactivity of React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This combination allows developers to leverage the strengths of both technologies to create a dynamic and responsive to-do list application.
